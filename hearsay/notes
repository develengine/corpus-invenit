@idea
* Have actors on a grid terrain.
* Have them interact with the world in some way.
* Have them remember the things that happen in some representation.
* Have them communicate these things to other actors by encoding/decoding them in/from the speech representation.
* Have them solve problems in their community. These problems are generated by some system.

@important
* The complexity should result from the interactions with each other and their predisposed behaviours.

@todo
1/9/2024:
[X] Create a new tile / position every frame until it fills the texture up.

30/9/2024:
[X] Draw a circle in the buffer.
[X] Transfer the circle to a GPU texture region.
[X] Render the thing as a tile on some position.
[X] Create a random tile with some basic gay algorithm.

29/9/2024:
[X] Make a guy and have him move around in some way.

28/9/2024:
[X] Fix zoom to be centered.
[X] Add guys to the world.
[X] Show their names above them.

21/9/2024:
[X] Grid terrain.
  [X] Draw tiles.
  [X] Zoom and move.
  [X] Height map with aerial occlusion. (Kinda like a simpler DF).


@wh-stories
- Communication
  - Spread the word of danger.
  - Spread the word of things of interest.
    - Novelty / Change

- This mostly just manages attention. Attention of both individuals and groups.
  - Influences seeking and avoidance behaviour.

  - Programs
    - Stories can carry methods of thought / behaviour.
      - These need to be given with a "proof" so that people internalize them.

- This way a method of thought can be discovered by someone by chance and then spread mostly involuntarily to others

  - Spread the model of thinking of others.

- This is important so that people can interact with each other better.
