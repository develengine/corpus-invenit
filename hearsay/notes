@idea
* Have actors on a grid terrain.
* Have them interact with the world in some way.
* Have them remember the things that happen in some representation.
* Have them communicate these things to other actors by encoding/decoding them in/from the speech representation.
* Have them solve problems in their community. These problems are generated by some system.


@todo
28/9/2024:
[X] Fix zoom to be centered.
[X] Add guys to the world.
[X] Show their names above them.
[ ] People moving around and stuff.
  [ ] Make a guy and have him move around in some way.
  [ ] Then have more and have them bump into each other or walk off the map.
    [ ] When they bump show a little indicator effect on the screen.
    [ ] When they walk off a steep edge, they also get the same indicator.
    [ ] They can get up any ledge, but the steeper it is the more energy and time it takes.

[X] Grid terrain.
  [X] Draw tiles.
  [X] Zoom and move.
  [X] Height map with aerial occlusion. (Kinda like a simpler DF).


@stories
- Communication
  - Spread the word of danger.
  - Spread the word of things of interest.
    - Novelty / Change

- This mostly just manages attention. Attention of both individuals and groups.
  - Influences seeking and avoidance behaviour.

  - Programs
    - Stories can carry methods of thought / behaviour.
      - These need to be given with a "proof" so that people internalize them.

- This way a method of thought can be discovered by someone by chance and then spread mostly involuntarily to others

  - Spread the model of thinking of others.

- This is important so that people can interact with each other better.
